# Incremental scroller (enhanced build, branch `enhanced/scroll`)

Replaces the original full-screen redraws (`RedrawScreen`, a 288-blit redraw plus a 46 KB CPU copy
every time the view crosses a 16-px tile boundary) with buffers that are updated one tile column or
row at a time.

## Status

| Step | State |
|---|---|
| Test harness: blitter, copper and display emulation on top of the 68000 emulator (`tools/amiga.py`) | done; reproduces the original display exactly (`tools/check_harness.py`: 16 of 16 views equal the level pictures) |
| Background scroller: layout, tile drawing, edge columns / rows, copper list with ring wrap (`src/scroll.s`) | done as a standalone module; equal to the original at every camera position tested (`tools/test_scroll.py`: 560 of 560 frames over all 7 levels, random walks with steps of 1-40 px, two buffers updated alternately) |
| BOBs: `DrawBob` / `RestoreBackground` with the corkscrew addressing, restore from the pristine buffer, ring-wrap split | to do |
| Scenery drawn into the pristine buffer (`DrawSceneryOnRedraw`), text printed on the playfield | to do |
| Integration into the game: camera / redraw logic, `SetBitplanePtrs`, `SwapScreens`, `ShowBackBuffer`, memory map | to do |
| Full-emulator test (WinUAE / FS-UAE) for timing | to do |

## The corkscrew works with the interleaved layout

The screen stays line-interleaved, as in the original: each 180-byte line holds the 5 planes'
36-byte rows. (The first version of the prototype used separate bitplanes, on the mistaken view
that a corkscrew can't work interleaved; it can, and the interleaved version passes the same test.)

Scrolling right moves the bitplane pointers on one word, so each plane's 34-byte fetch runs 2 bytes
further into memory. Past the end of its own row it reads the start of the next plane's row (plane 4:
the next line's plane 0). Those bytes belonged to that plane's leftmost column, which has itself
just scrolled off the left, so they are free: that is exactly where the new right-hand column is
drawn. In memory terms every plane row is one link in a single chain, and the address of a pixel is
linear in its column, so nothing ever has to move.

Advantages over separate planes:

* **A tile is one blit** (16 lines x 5 planes, D modulo 34), as in the original `RedrawScreen`.
* **A BOB restore is one blit,** and BOBs can use either mask scheme: one-plane masks with 5
  cookie-cut blits (as the 512K build, minus its 2 mask-building blits; +20% memory), or fully
  pre-masked graphics with one blit (as the 1MB build; +100%).
* **Less memory:** the corkscrew slack is needed once per buffer, not once per plane.

## Layout

```
buffer:               180 * 256 + 1040 = 47,120 bytes
world tile column C:  byte 2*(C+1) of a plane row          (corkscrew: never moves)
world line y (Y up):  ring line (-1-y) & 255, line address = 180 * ring line
plane p:              + 36*p
pixel (C, y, p):      base + 2*(C+1) + 180*((-1-y) & 255) + 36*p
```

* The mapping is the same for every buffer, so a rectangle can be blitted from the pristine buffer to
  the same offset in a display buffer.
* **Corkscrew drift:** scrolling right by 16 px moves the start by 2 bytes, so the buffer needs 2
  bytes per world column of slack: 1,040 bytes covers levels up to 512 columns (32 map cells, the
  whole world map width).
* **Aliasing:** (C, plane p) shares memory with (C+18, plane p-1) of the same line, so a buffer
  holds at most 18 columns (17 are fetched); the 256-line ring holds 16 tile rows (14-15 visible).
* **Copper:** the playfield list (jumped to at line `$44`, after the 16-line HUD strip) sets the 5
  pointers (36 bytes apart), modulo 146 (180 - 34 fetched) and the fine scroll in BPLCON1. Where the ring wraps inside the
  display it waits for that line (with the `$FFDF` wait past line 255) and reloads the pointers
  with the start of ring line 0.
* **Camera:** the same values as the original (x = `g_ScrollTileX`*16 + `g_ScrollFineX`, y =
  `g_ScrollTileY`*16 + `g_ScrollFineY`), so the rest of the game's coordinates are unchanged.

## Memory

| | Original | Enhanced |
|---|---:|---:|
| Display buffers | 4 x 46,080 (two shown, two being redrawn) | 2 x 47,120 |
| Pristine background | - | 47,120 |
| Total | 184,320 | 141,360 |
| BOB background save areas | 2 x 12,288 (in the graphics load buffers) | none (restore from the pristine buffer) |

So about 43 KB saved on the screens, and the save areas go as well.

## Cost per frame (from the test)

* **Original:** every 16-px boundary crossing triggers a full redraw: 288 blits of 80 words
  (23,040 words) plus a 46,080-byte CPU copy. It runs in the background and forces logic freezes
  when falling.
* **Enhanced:** a new column is about 15 tile blits of 80 words (1,200 words); a row 18 blits. In the
  test walks, the frames that needed drawing blitted a median of 1,440 words. A full draw (level
  start, big jumps) is 255 blits / 20,400 words, about the same as one original redraw.
* With a pristine buffer, each edge is drawn once into the pristine buffer and copied into the two
  display buffers (a column is one 1-word-wide blit, modulo 34). Today the
  prototype draws each buffer's edges from the tiles directly; switching to the pristine copy is
  part of the BOB step.

## Files

* `src/scroll.s`: the scroller module (`ScrFullDraw`, `ScrScrollTo`, `ScrBuildCopper`), assembled at
  `$7A000` for the harness.
* `tools/amiga.py`: harness: 68000 + blitter + copper + display renderer.
* `tools/original.py`: drives the original game's display code in the harness (the reference).
* `tools/check_harness.py`: checks the harness against the level pictures in `render/out/`.
* `tools/test_scroll.py`: the scroller against the original, frame by frame.

## Next steps

1. **Pristine buffer + BOBs:** adapt `DrawBob` / `RestoreBackground` to the corkscrew addressing
   (clip to the 17 fetched columns; split a BOB that crosses the ring wrap into two blits), draw edges into the pristine buffer and copy them to the display buffers. Test by drawing
   the game's own BOB lists in the harness against the original.
2. **Scenery and text:** `DrawSceneryOnRedraw` draws into the pristine buffer when its column comes
   into view; check every routine that writes to the screen buffers (text such as "TAKE A KEY").
3. **Integration:** a separate source tree derived from `gng_main.s`. Replace the redraw request and
   switch logic in the camera code (`$6EF2`; `tools/verify/camera.py` documents it) with
   `ScrScrollTo` every frame, drop `g_SkipLogic` freezes, `RedrawEntry`, `CameraJump`'s buffer
   rotation and the 4-buffer pointers, and move the buffers in the memory map.
4. **512K and 1MB builds;** then full-emulator tests.
